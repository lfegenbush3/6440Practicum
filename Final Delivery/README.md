To access the application, go here: https://lfegenbush3.github.io/6440Practicum/launch-patient.html?iss=https://fhir-myrecord.cerner.com/dstu2/ec2458f2-1e24-41c8-b71b-0e701af7583d

You will be taken to a page to login with a user name and password. You can use the following user name/password or reference additional test users in the 6440 Practicum Test Cases.xlsx document in this directory. username/password: wilmasmart/Cerner01

After entering the user name/password, you will be taken to a screen requesting access. Click the button 'Allow Access'. 

From here, you will be taken to the main screen of the application and you can browse the application from there.

You can also access the application using a direct link generated from the SMART App Launcher (https://launch.smarthealthit.org/?auth_error=&fhir_version_2=r4&iss=&launch_pt=1&launch_url=&patient=&prov_skip_auth=1&provider=&pt_skip_auth=1&public_key=&sde=&token_lifetime=15&user_pt=) tool. Links in the 6440 Practicum Test Cases.xlsx are configured to bypass authentication so the application will load directly.
